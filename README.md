# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdilaahe Omar  

Cybersecurity Professional | Network Security | Threat Detection | Automation & Compliance  

I’m a dedicated cybersecurity analyst and security operations professional with a strong foundation in **network defense, threat analysis, and vulnerability management**. My mission is to protect, monitor, and strengthen organizational systems using a blend of hands-on tools, structured methodologies, and industry frameworks.

Currently pursuing to expand my career in Cybersecurity, while continuously building my portfolio of **real-world labs**, **scripts**, and **incident response simulations**.

---

## 🛡️ Focus Areas
- **Blue Team Operations:** Threat hunting, SIEM monitoring (Splunk, Wazuh), incident response, and forensic triage.
- **Red Team Exercises:** Attack emulation using Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite to strengthen detection and response capabilities.
- **Network Security:** Secure baseline configurations, firewall tuning, IDS/IPS setup, and packet analysis using Wireshark and Zeek.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Scanning, prioritizing, and remediating system vulnerabilities with OpenVAS, Nessus, and CVSS metrics.
- **Security Automation:** Python and PowerShell scripting for log parsing, alert correlation, and vulnerability reporting.
- **Compliance & Auditing:** Aligning security policies with **NIST 800-53**, **NIST CSF**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, and **CIS Controls** for audit readiness and continuous improvement.
